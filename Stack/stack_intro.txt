Stack operation
1.isEmplty(): returns ture if stack is emplty else false
2.push(x)
3.pop()
4.peak():return the top most item from stack
5.size(): return the size of the stack


Two corner conditions of stack operation
1.underflow(): when pop() or peak() called on empty stack
2.overflow: when push called on full stack
NOTE: we need to halde this error using exception


Stack in python(IMPLEMENT) 4 ways:
1.using List/Array
2.using collections.deque
3.using queue.LIFOQueue(not preferrable)
4.using linked list 
NOTE: Generally we use List/Collection.deque or linked list
